Congrats! You've launched a beautiful new Eleventy-powered blog.

Each blog post lives in the `posts` folderâ€“take a look at one by opening it in the editor.

* Posts use [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) (`.md`) syntax, which is more lightweight to write and read than HTML
* Each post contains __front matter__ defining metadata such as the date, title, and layout

Layouts for your site are in `_includes`

Your pages and posts can use these to define an outline structure their content is containined within.
